			 I have done my Intermediate at MahatiJr.college although it was only on paper.The coaching class where I got trained is Paravyoma classes.It was a very beautiful place,one of the best places I have been to.The teachers are really nice and caring and are self-less. I am sorry as I donot have any web site where you can get to know of it.
