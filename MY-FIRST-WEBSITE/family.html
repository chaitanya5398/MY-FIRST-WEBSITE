  <p> All in all I have a very nice and loving family,who care a lot for me.I also love all of them.As an English saying says,you get to know the  value of things only when you are away from them.
			

			 My value and love for family has increased a lot after I have come to the hostel.So,all the things are in a sense good for us,it all depends on the way you see and percieve things.
			 
			 This is about my family.I hope everyone has a nice and cute family as this and hope you enjoyed reading this page.</p>
