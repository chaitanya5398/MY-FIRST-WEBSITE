		  <h3> MY HOBBIES AND LIKES</h3>
		  <section class="cl">
			 <h4>CRICKET</h4>
			 <p><img src="PHOTOS/cricket.gif" alt="CRICKET" id="cric" >
				I like the game cricket.I used to play it all the way in my childhood and was also a very adrent viewer of the game.I gave up following the game of late.But,recently I have played it again after many days and  saw that I didn't forget the game although I am not fit currently.I always supported Team India but I actually liked the game of Australian players and my favourite player happens to  be the former wicket-keeper of the Australian team- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gilchrist" target="_blank"><em>ADAM GILCRIST.</em></a>

			 <h4>MUSIC</h4>
			 <p> I like to hear very soft music which is really soothing to the heart.I rejooice such music and am really happy to hear it.I am not so much in favour of fast beat,although I like a few of them now and then.</p>

			 <h4>MATHEMATICS AND REASONING</h4>
			 <p>  This is one of the areas which I like very much.This doesn't mean that I am all very good at it.<img src="PHOTOS/bt.jpg" alt="BRAIN TEASERS" id="bt">I am an average person in this,but I like this because it gives a lot of satisfaction to get an answer while the other half is always there that is equally cumbersome if you are really struckup somewhere cluelessly.<img src="PHOTOS/rb.jpg" alt="rubick's cube" id="cube" >The famous Rubick's cube is one of the things which come to mind.I learnt it but in a very naive manner following a book.I would rather like to do it intutively and in a problem-specific manner. </p>
